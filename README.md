# Python-MusicPlayer
Python program which acts as a music player, capable of storing multiple user's data and music playlists, allows users to create new account, and has all music player functions: Play/Pause, Skip/Rewind, create a playlist, and loading songs from a locally hosted library of music files. Note: GitHub doesn't allow files over a certain size to be uploaded, hence the audio files could not be uploaded. This repository only contains the program file, not the mp3 music files, which will affect your usage of the program.
